Upon reflection, you can use the more abstract class or interface name when declaring objects, but then apply the concrete class on initialization. Honestly, we didn't even know you could do that before this semester. I learned that its much easier to write programs when you can use the existing collections instead of creating them on your own (I am referring to computer science one and two courses). Also, this helped confirm the concepts behind concatenation as discussed in the most recent reading. Lastly, we learned that having Junit tests available helps to efficiently complete segment of the projects by debugging on specific unit tests. Also upon reviewing the criteria of the program we realized that passing the unit tests alone is not enough to insure that we have fully complied with all specifications.
